# RL-PPO-Keras

This is an implementation of proximal policy optimization(PPO) algorithm with Keras.

## Usage

Start an experiment:

``python main.py``

## Code

* ``run_exp.py``

	Create environment and agent. Agent interacts with enviornment and learns with samples.

* ``config.py``

   Configuration about agent, environment, experiment, and path.

* ``ppo.py``

    Implementation of PPO algorithm.
